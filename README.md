# threejsTesting
Testing out some three.js.
Not architected super well, just mostly learning typescipt and threejs stuff.

Should be able to run with:

`npm install`

`npx tsc`

`npx vite`

The liquid is a separate mesh that gets pixels discarded in the pixel shader based on Y value.  Outline done in pixel shade based on fresnel effect I was learning about.
